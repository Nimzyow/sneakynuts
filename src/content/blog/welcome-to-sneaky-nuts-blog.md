# Sneaky Nuts Welcome Blog

Creating a blog, am I in 2005 or something? üñäÔ∏è

Yes, this style of blog creation is a relic of the past, sure, but I feel it's still a wonderful avenue to release some steam and unleash a bit of creativity.

The modern day alternatives are a quick 30 second TikTok video, but I'm old school, I like to actually read and write. I find it wonderful to pick up a good old fashioned crime novel and read it, obsess over every word, engage with the dark sorcery that is the written word.

However, I know the trend these days is moving towards quick, short and snappy video content. I won't say this is sad nor do I intend on painting this trend in a negative light. It's just the way the people of today wish to consume their content.

Through creating this blog, I do not wish to make it look like I'm turning my back towards the "in" thing nor do I wish to rebel against current media consumption trends. I hope this blog and the upcoming blogs serve as a creative spark that will involve me one day also creating small TikTok videos on the side.

For now though, I intend on blogging my thoughts on a variety of subject matter that interests me or may frustrate me. I expect my fellow colleague who I founded sneakynuts with will do the same also!

Subject matter will almost certainly involve technology, video games, work, side projects, general well being, books and novels etc‚Ä¶

So there isn't one niche that I'm going to be covering nor am I interested in covering a niche. I'm just going to talk about what's on my mind and I hope someone out there finds whatever is written to be remotely useful or interesting to read.

Rest assured, I won't be using AI to generate actual blog content and I will not use AI to pretend to act as me. Every word I write is straight from me and my colleague and it will come from the good old, raw, blood pumping human heart!

Many thanks for reading
